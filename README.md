# A Reminder App for recurrent tasks
I learn by crafting, this is my  way to `React`, `Next.js`, `FaunaDB`, `One Signal` and Cloudfare `Workers`.
Is a monorepo containing the frontend, (a static nextjs app) to deploy in static enviroments like Cloudfare Pages, and the backend as a Worker.
Will be nice to eventually take this close to metal and enable mobile alarm capabilities, alarms for cook checkings, medicines intervals, eye rest, water taking, you named.
Go to the [**app**](https://reminder-app-fronted.pages.dev/).
